# Emotion-Recognition-for-Robots

A Report Presented in the School of Computing, Electronics and Mathematics, Coventry University, for the degree of Bachelor of Science in Mathematics and Data Analytics, April 2022


In this project, six models with a help of CNN and two datasets were produced to extract facial features in order to recognize emotions. The CK+ dataset was one of the image databases that was used to train the models. 981 images of 7 emotions: angry, contempt, neutral, happy, sad, surprised, disgust, were set for testing. Another CNN models were developed by using 2100 images of the FER 2013 dataset, which also considered 7 emotions. Both databases used accuracy and loss to evaluate their best results and various configurations of hyperparameters were examined to find the highest possible recognition rate. Moreover, seven emotions were evaluated using f-score, precision, and recall. 

Motivation for project:
- Increased contribution of computer systems in our daily life 
- Era of “Internet + artificial-intelligence + emotion”
- Imperfections in the system

Scope of research:
- Relies on data sets of images which later are used to train the model 
- Project does not examine other possibilities of recognizing emotions, like speech or body posture 

Methdodology:
-   FER 2013 
    - Displays seven different facial emotions: anger; contempt; disgust; fear; happiness; sadness; and surprise 

The attached code only shows one out of six models that were done for this project.
